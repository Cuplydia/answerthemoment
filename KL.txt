CONSULTING

As a trusted provider of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) 
Consulting, I can assess, build, and implement a solution relevant to 
your business. I offer the added benefit of speaking your audience’s 
language and connecting in this space. My proposed solution will 
establish engaging and actionable learning experiences and strategies 
that support and sustain your desired outcomes.


I am a results-driven career and talent strategist devoted to 
advocating for underrepresented and untapped talent in others. My 
20+ years of HR and DEI experience range from Fortune 500 
corporations and manufacturers to digital start-ups. 

I have successfully developed and executed initiatives around diversity equity & 
inclusion, strategic planning, talent development and talent 
management. 

I am a thought-leader in the DEI space that is sought 
out for consulting, speaking engagements, coaching, training, 
mentorship, and leadership to influence, create space and disrupt in 
the name of authenticity, empowerment, excellence, and 
transformation.


My Unique Value-Add:

▪ 20+ years of dynamic, comprehensive, and uniquely inclusive experiences that 
span across industry types, people types, leadership levels, institution types, 
culture types, work method types.
▪ Strengthened and streamlined approach that helps you to keep peace of mind 
and pace of change as you lead your people, lead your business and empower 
your people to lead.
▪ A focus on holistic strategies that address nuances of behaviors that create 
successful execution
▪ A commitment to you to not just partner as a consultant, but also as mentor, 
coach, collaborator, expert, researcher, solution provider, facilitator, trainer and 
disrupter.
▪ Many moments standing with the outsiders; many moments navigating with 
insiders.
▪ I’ve lived the conversations that need to be had to create cultural change.
